# CORPORATE ESPIONAGE: THE GAME
## BY LILLY ZWIKKER

You are an Important Aerospace Company engineer and on instruction of the executives you have infiltrated the AIRBUS headquarters to steal their
 wing box designs for your new hypersonic passenger jet. You have just found the technical drawings and now have to escape the never ending maze of
  the AIRBUS headquarters. How far can you get without getting caught?

In each level, you first have to find the key and then sneak to the red exit door without being caught by the guards. Watch out, as they are not
 very smart and will walk in quite an erratic pattern. If you are stuck, you can press ESCAPE to restart the level. If you finish the level, the
  difficulty is increased.

Use WASD to walk and SHIFT to sprint.

Press ALT+F4 to exit
